Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an interactive Excel sales dashboard to transform raw sales data into actionable insights. The process includes converting the dataset into a structured Excel Table, formatting columns, and using PivotTables to analyze key metrics such as total sales by year, profit by category, and top customers. Various charts are created from these PivotTables to visually represent trends and performance. To enhance interactivity, slicers are added, allowing users to dynamically filter charts and tables. The final dashboard is refined for clarity, with clear labels and functional slicers, providing a comprehensive tool for analyzing sales data.
